# micro-frontend
The example of micro frontend architecture using Skipper, Tailor, and whatever view framework (React, Angular, VueJS,...)

## Architecture
* [Skipper](https://github.com/zalando/skipper): As a HTTP router for seamless routing between each micro-app and backend service.
* [Tailor.js](https://github.com/zalando/tailor): As a Layout Service to wrap together header and micro-app fragment and serve it to user.
* [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle): As a Fragment/Content Service.
